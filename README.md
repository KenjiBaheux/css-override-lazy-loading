Overriding the lazy loading behavior of assets
=========================

A proposal for CSS to let web developers override CSS's lazy loading behavior.

#Background#
By design, in CSS, assets like fonts are lazy-loaded. 

This is a sane default behavior, as it allows web developers to re-use the same CSS file containing all the required definitions accross all pages in a given website without having to worry about superfluous downloads of assets. It also enables the unicode-range behavior in @font-face.

Unfortunately, in the case of fonts, this also contributes to the "blank text" problem: the page appears rendered but the text content is invisible for a while. This is because the font is only downloaded when it has been determined that itâ€™s absolutely needed.

A good web developer should have a good idea of which assets are critical.

For fonts, while the Font Loading API offers a solution to these problems, it requires JavaScript and a non trivial amount of effort from web developers. Also, if you use a third party library for your asset loading needs, it introduces an extra RTT.

#Strawman#
Allow web developers to give hints to the user agent about which assets matter.

```
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Open Sans';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  src: local('Open Sans'), local('OpenSans'),
  url(http://example.com/opensans/normal400.woff2) format('woff2'),
  url(http://example.com/opensans/normal400.eot) format('eot');
}

.myawesomebg {
 background-image: url('awesome.png');
}

.maintext {
 font-size: 2.5em;
 font-family: 'Open Sans';
 font-weight: 400;
}

@will-use {
  .maintext;
  .myawesomebg;
}
```


In which case the user agent can infer that actively downloading *Open Sans 400* as well as *awesome.png* should pay off.
